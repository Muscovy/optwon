Kris:
    Begin work on Personality Cores.

Alex:
    Flesh out typos.
    
COMPLETED:
    Add typo-creating function to chatter-ers
    Add Typing delay to chatter-ers
    Add Word Based sentence construction to databank.
    Add Word based node search to databank.
    Make modded version of Aubergine that has a on/off switch for his talk (based on PM?), then let him listen to #Nebtown for like 3 hours. Then we turn him on.
    Add quit, channel change, nick change functions to IRC Core.

REDACTED:
    (Possible) Add "Place in tree" attribute to Nodes. So 1st word = Pos 1, 2nd word = Parent.pos += 1. Allows for cool generation of word charts?
    Add Chance factor to Aubergine (chance to say word based node search, chance to say frequency weighted node search, chance to say random node search (both forward and reverse)
    Refactor method names in databank (right now it's messy)
    Add Frequency based weighting for sentence building. (I don't know about this one.)
